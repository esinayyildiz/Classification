# Classification
In the first quesiton, I loaded the Boston dataset from sklearn and splited the dataset into training and testing parts. I used ridge regression to predict the target values. I tried with both the original attributes and polynomial features (preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures(2,interaction_only=True)). I determined the best regularization coefficient in each case. Plot true value vs. predicted values.
In the second question, I loaded the MNIST data set from sklearn and splited the data set into training and testing parts. I used theKNNclassifier and tried different K values and analyze the performances.
